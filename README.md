# Consumer Goods Ad-Hoc Analytics Project
This project is the part of codebasics resume project challenge #04. 
## Project Overview
The project involved analyzing AtliQ Harware's sales, customer, and product data using SQL queries and stored procedures to generate various business insights. The main objective was to extract valuable information from multiple datasets to support decision-making in sales strategies, product development, and market expansion.
## Key Metrics Identified:
- Customer markets
- Products count
- Unique product growth
- Top selling products
- Gross sales
- Customer discount analysis
  
This project also includes writing stored procedures for reusable reports for AtliQ Hardware such as Top N products by Net Sales, Top N markets by Net Sales, Top N markets per region by Gross Sales, Top N customers by Net Sales.
## Key Skills Learned:
### Data Querying:
- Learned how to write complex SQL queries to extract data from multiple tables using JOIN, UNION, and GROUP BY.
- Learned how to filter specific data using conditions (WHERE, ORDER BY).
### CTEs (Common Table Expression):
- Gained a understanding of CTEs to structure complex queries efficiently, especially when calculating intermediate steps such as the product growth rates and segment-based comparisons.
### Window Functions:
- Learned to use window functions like DENSE_RANK and SUM() OVER() to rank and calculate cumulative sales across different product divisions or sales channels.
### Aggregate Function:
- Used aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, and ROUND to calculate totals, averages, and percentages across product and sales data.
### Stored Procedures:
- Developed stored procedures to automate reporting tasks, which allow for easy reuse of SQL code and reduce manual effort when generating insights based on changing inputs like year, market, or number of top results.
